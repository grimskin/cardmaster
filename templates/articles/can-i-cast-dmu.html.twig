    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <div class="p">
        This article is heavily inspired by
        <a target="_blank"
           href="https://strategy.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/home/how-many-sources-do-you-need-to-consistently-cast-your-spells-a-2022-update/">
            Frank Karsten's "How many sources do you need"
        </a>
        . He did a great job, but it
        made me curious to look at numbers a bit deeper. For example, not only how often you'll have proper colors if
        you drew enough lands, but also - what are the chances of both events together, basically - how often you'll be
        able to cast multicolored 3-drop on turn 3. There are numerous options in Magic when it comes to mana -
        phyrexian, colorless, hybrid, lands that produce more than 1 mana at a time, e.t.c. Thus I decided to narrow
        down the area covered by the article to the Limited format, specifically - "Dominaria United" Limited. This
        article probably won't provide you with any additional guidelines on building your mana base, but I hope it will
        entertain you a bit.

    <h3>Methodology and assumptions</h3>
    <div class="p">
        To get estimations I’ve used the Monte Carlo method. This means that I’ve created a small piece of code that
        simulates deck shuffle, draw, and mulligan processes and ran the simulation enough times (at least 1’000’000 per
        check) to get an approximation. As a mana source, I’ve considered only basic lands – no mana-giving creatures or
        color filters were included in the simulation – mostly because that would create a whole new layer of different
        combinations and options. And no dual lands – because you won’t be able to pick some in your colors every time.
        As for mulligan – I’ve included a short description of the process in the appendix.

    <h3>Mono-colored spells in mono-colored decks</h3>

    <div class="p">
        In a mono-colored deck possibility to cast X-drop on turn X means just having X lands on turn X.
    </div>

    <div class="p">
        <table class="experiment-results">
            <tr>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <th>Turn 1</th>
                <th>Turn 2</th>
                <th>Turn 3</th>
                <th>Turn 4</th>
                <th>Turn 5</th>
                <th>Turn 6</th>
                <th>Turn 7</th>
            </tr>
            {% for lands, row in monoInMono %}
                <tr>
                    <th>{{ lands }}</th>
                    {% for result in row %}
                        <td>{{ (100 * result['success'] / result['total'])|number_format(3) }}</td>
                    {% endfor %}
                </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        </table>
    </div>

    <div class="p">
        Being able to play X-drop on turn X is great, but sometimes we’re fine with playing them a turn later,
        especially if we are talking about spells that cost 4 mana or more.
